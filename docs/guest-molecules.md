| H2 | Hydrogen molecule. [[https://www.britannica.com/science/hydrogen](https://www.britannica.com/science/hydrogen)] |
| ch4, co2 | An all-atom methane model. |
| et, me | A united-atom methane model. |
| mol | Loader for MOL files (generated by MolView.org), e.g. mol[THF.mol]. |
| thf | An all-atom tetrahydrofuran (THF) model. |
| uathf | A united-atom five-site tetrahydrofuran (THF) model. |
| empty, g12, g14, g15, g16, one, uathf6 | (Undocumented) |


For THF, `uathf` is a 5-site united-atom model; `uathf6` adds a dummy site (e.g. for some force fields). Both can be used with `-g` (e.g. `-g 16=uathf` or `-g 16=uathf6`).

You can add custom guest molecules by placing plugins in a `molecules` directory in the current working directory.

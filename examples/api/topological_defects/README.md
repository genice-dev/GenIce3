**Topological defects** (Bjerrum defects, H3O⁺, OH⁻).

- `12_topological_defect.py`  
  - Introduce hydronium (H3O⁺) and hydroxide (OH⁻) defects at specified coordinates.

- `13_topological_defect2.py`  
  - Introduce Bjerrum L and D defects at specified coordinates.

Additional implementations for the same topics (e.g., CLI- or config-file–driven variants) may be added here in the future.

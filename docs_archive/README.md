# Archived docs (formerly `docs/`)

This directory contains the **previous** documentation: Jekyll-related config and Cursor-generated design/notes. The GenIce3 project no longer uses Jekyll here.

The **current manual** is built with **MkDocs (Material)** from the `docs/` directory at the repo root. The site is published to GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch (see `.github/workflows/mkdocs.yml`).

You can keep this archive for reference or remove it if not needed.
